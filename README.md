# Otto Neural Network

A simple three layer neural network implemented with Breeze using the otto dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/otto-group-product-classification-challenge). 
It uses the LBFGS optimizer to find the optimal theta vector, but unfortunately the lowest logloss 
achieved was only 0.55033.
